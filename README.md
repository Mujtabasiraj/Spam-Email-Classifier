# üß† DESCRIPTION

This project builds an intelligent **Spam Email Classifier** that detects and filters spam messages automatically based on their textual content.  
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning algorithms** like **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to distinguish between legitimate (ham) and spam emails.  

The system learns patterns in text ‚Äî such as word frequency and token structure ‚Äî that commonly appear in spam, enabling it to classify unseen emails with high accuracy.  
This helps users protect their inboxes, automate filtering, and reduce the risk of phishing and unwanted mail.

# ‚öôÔ∏è WORKFLOW

1. **Dataset Loading**  
   - The system uses the popular **SpamBase dataset** or **SMS Spam Collection dataset** containing labeled examples of spam and ham messages.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Convert all text to lowercase  
   - Remove punctuation and stopwords  
   - Tokenize and apply **TF-IDF vectorization** for numerical representation  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Two models can be implemented:
     - **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - Both are trained and compared based on accuracy and precision.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the model using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**.  

5. **Prediction**  
   - Users can input custom email text to classify it as *Spam* or *Not Spam*.
